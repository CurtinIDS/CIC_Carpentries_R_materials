This lesson is adapted from the [Data Carpentry Ecology Lessons 1 ](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html) and
 [Data Carpentry Ecology Lessons 2 ](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html)

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Execute code chunks by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** or OS X: **Cmd + Shift + Enter**.
To execute a specific line within a code chunk, placing your cursor on that line and pressing **Ctrl + Enter** or OS X: **Cmd + Enter**.


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing **Ctrl + Alt + I** or OS X: **Cmd + Option + I**.

When you save the notebook, a HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press **Ctrl + Shift + K** or OS X: **Cmd + Shift + K** to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Creating objects in R

You can get output from R simply by typing math in the console:

```{r}
3 + 5
12 / 7
```

However, to do useful and interesting things, we need to assign _values_ to
_objects_. To create an object, we need to give it a name followed by the
assignment operator `<-`, and the value we want to give it:

```{r}
weight_kg <- 55
```

`<-` is the assignment operator. It assigns values on the right to objects on
the left. So, after executing `x <- 3`, the value of `x` is `3`. The arrow can
be read as 3 **goes into** `x`.  
For historical reasons, you can also use `=` for assignments, but not in every context. _Note_ `<-` assigns values to your global environment, i.e. they can be used throughout your scripts.

> In RStudio, typing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> (push <kbd>Alt</kbd> at the
> same time as the <kbd>-</kbd> key) will write ` <- ` in a single keystroke in a PC, 
>
> while typing <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> (push <kbd>Option</kbd> at the same time as the <kbd>-</kbd> key) does the same in a Mac.

Naming objects:

- they can have any name, e.g. `x`, `id`, `new_id`
- they **cannot** start with a number, `2x` is not valid, but `x2` is
- R is case sensitive so `id` is different from `ID`
- there are some reserved names, e.g., `if`, `else`, `for` (see
[here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html) for a complete list)
- It's good to avoid dots (`.`) within names. Many function names in R itself have them and dots also have a special meaning (methods) in R and other programming languages.
- recommended to use nouns for object names, and verbs for function names. 

> ### Objects vs. variables
>
> What are known as `objects` in `R` are known as `variables` in many other
> programming languages. Depending on the context, `object` and `variable` can
> have drastically different meanings. However, in this lesson, the two words
> are used synonymously. For more information see:
> https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Objects

When assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can force R to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the object name:

```{r}
weight_kg <- 55    # doesn't print anything
(weight_kg <- 55)  # but putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`
weight_kg          # and so does typing the name of the object
```

Now that R has `weight_kg` in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. For
instance, we may want to convert this weight into pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):

```{r}
2.2 * weight_kg
```

We can also change an object's value by assigning it a new one:

```{r}
weight_kg <- 57.5
2.2 * weight_kg
```

This means that assigning a value to one object does not change the values of
other objects  For example, let's store the animal's weight in pounds in a new
object, `weight_lb`:

```{r}
weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg
```

and then change `weight_kg` to 100.

```{r}
weight_kg <- 100
```

What do you think is the current content of the object `weight_lb`? 126.5 or 220?

> ### Comments
>
> The comment character in R is `#`, anything to the right of a `#` in a script will be ignored by R. It is useful to leave notes and explanations in your scripts.
> RStudio makes it easy to comment or uncomment a paragraph: after selecting the lines you  want to comment, press at the same time on your keyboard <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>. If you only want to comment out one line, you can put the cursor at any location of that line (i.e. no need to select the whole line), then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.

## Functions and their arguments

Functions are "canned scripts" that automate more complicated sets of commands
including operations assignments, etc. Many functions are predefined, or can be
made available by importing R *packages* (more on that later). A function
usually takes one or more inputs called *arguments*. Functions often (but not
always) return a *value*. A typical example would be the function `sqrt()`. The
input (the argument) must be a number, and the return value (in fact, the
output) is the square root of that number. Executing a function ('running it')
is called *calling* the function. An example of a function call is:

```{r}
ten <- sqrt(weight_kg)
```

Here, the value of `ten` is given to the `sqrt()` function, the `sqrt()` function
calculates the square root, and returns the value which is then assigned to
the object `weight_kg`. This function is very simple, because it takes just one argument.

The return 'value' of a function need not be numerical (like that of `sqrt()`),
and it also does not need to be a single item: it can be a set of things, or
even a dataset. We'll see that when we read data files into R.

Arguments can be anything, not only numbers or filenames, but also other
objects. Exactly what each argument means differs per function, and must be
looked up in the documentation (see below). Some functions take arguments which
may either be specified by the user, or, if left out, take on a *default* value:
these are called *options*. Options are typically used to alter the way the
function operates, such as whether it ignores 'bad values', or what symbol to
use in a plot.  However, if you want something specific, you can specify a value
of your choice which will be used instead of the default.

Let's try a function that can take multiple arguments: `round()`.

```{r}
round(3.14159)
```

Here, we've called `round()` with just one argument, `3.14159`, and it has
returned the value `3`.  That's because the default is to round to the nearest
whole number. If we want more digits we can see how to do that by getting
information about the `round` function.  We can use `args(round)` to find what 
arguments it takes, or look at the
help for this function using `?round`.

```{r}
args(round)
```

```{r}
?round
```

We see that if we want a different number of digits, we can
type `digits = 2` or however many we want.

```{r}
round(3.14159, digits = 2)
```

If you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined you
don't have to name them:

```{r}
round(3.14159, 2)
```

And if you do name the arguments, you can switch their order:

```{r}
round(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)
```

It's good practice to put the non-optional arguments (like the number you're
rounding) first in your function call, and to then specify the names of all optional
arguments.  If you don't, someone reading your code might have to look up the
definition of a function with unfamiliar arguments to understand what you're
doing.


## Vectors and data types

A vector is the most common and basic data type in R, and is pretty much
the workhorse of R. A vector is composed by a series of values, which can be
either numbers or characters. We can assign a series of values to a vector using
the `c()` function. For example we can create a vector of animal weights and assign
it to a new object `weight_g`:

```{r}
weight_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
weight_g
```

A vector can also contain characters:

```{r}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog")
animals
```

The quotes around "mouse", "rat", etc. are essential here. Without the quotes R
will assume objects have been created called `mouse`, `rat` and `dog`. As these objects
don't exist in R's memory, there will be an error message.

There are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a
vector. `length()` tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:

```{r}
length(weight_g)
length(animals)
```

An important feature of a vector, is that all of the elements are the same type of data.
The function `class()` indicates the class (the type of element) of an object:

```{r}
class(weight_g)
class(animals)
```

The function `str()` provides an overview of the structure of an object and its
elements. It is a useful function when working with large and complex
objects:

```{r}
str(weight_g)
str(animals)
```

You can use the `c()` function to add other elements to your vector:
```{r}
weight_g <- c(weight_g, 90) # add to the end of the vector
weight_g <- c(30, weight_g) # add to the beginning of the vector
weight_g
```

In the first line, we take the original vector `weight_g`,
add the value `90` to the end of it, and save the result back into
`weight_g`. Then we add the value `30` to the beginning, again saving the result
back into `weight_g`.

We can do this over and over again to grow a vector, or assemble a dataset.
As we program, this may be useful to add results that we are collecting or
calculating.

An **atomic vector** is the simplest R **data type** and is a linear vector of a single type. Above, we saw 
2 of the 6 main **atomic vector** types  that R
uses: `"character"` and `"numeric"` (or `"double"`). These are the basic building blocks that
all R objects are built from. The other 4 **atomic vector** types are:

* `"logical"` for `TRUE` and `FALSE` (the boolean data type)
* `"integer"` for integer numbers (e.g., `2L`, the `L` indicates to R that it's an integer)
* `"complex"` to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g.,
`1 + 4i`) and that's all we're going to say about them
* `"raw"` for bitstreams that we won't discuss further

You can check the type of your vector using the `typeof()` function and inputting your vector as the argument.

Vectors are one of the many **data structures** that R uses. Other important
ones are lists (`list`), matrices (`matrix`), data frames (`data.frame`),
factors (`factor`) and arrays (`array`).

## Subsetting vectors

If we want to extract one or several values from a vector, we must provide one
or several indices in square brackets. For instance:

```{r}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[2]
animals[c(3, 2)]
```

We can also repeat the indices to create an object with more elements than the
original one:

```{r}
more_animals <- animals[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]
more_animals
```

R indices start at 1. Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB, Julia, and R start
counting at 1, because that's what human beings typically do. Languages in the C
family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0 because that's
simpler for computers to do.

### Conditional subsetting

Another common way of subsetting is by using a logical vector. `TRUE` will
select the element with the same index, while `FALSE` will not:

```{r }
weight_g <- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)
weight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]
```

Typically, these logical vectors are not typed by hand, but are the output of
other functions or logical tests. For instance, if you wanted to select only the
values above 50:

```{r }
weight_g > 50    # will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet the condition
## so we can use this to select only the values above 50
weight_g[weight_g > 50]
```

You can combine multiple tests using `&` (both conditions are true, AND) or `|`
(at least one of the conditions is true, OR):

```{r }
weight_g[weight_g < 30 | weight_g > 50]
weight_g[weight_g >= 30 & weight_g == 21]
```

Here, `<` stands for "less than", `>` for "greater than", `>=` for "greater than
or equal to", and `==` for "equal to". The double equal sign `==` is a test for
numerical equality between the left and right hand sides, and should not be
confused with the single `=` sign, which performs variable assignment (similar
to `<-`).

A common task is to search for certain strings in a vector.  One could use the
"or" operator `|` to test for equality to multiple values, but this can quickly
become tedious. The function `%in%` allows you to test if any of the elements of
a search vector are found:

```{r }
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[animals == "cat" | animals == "rat"] # returns both rat and cat
animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")
animals[animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")]
```

## Missing data

As R was designed to analyze datasets, it includes the concept of missing data
(which is uncommon in other programming languages). Missing data are represented
in vectors as `NA`.

When doing operations on numbers, most functions will return `NA` if the data
you are working with include missing values. This feature
makes it harder to overlook the cases where you are dealing with missing data.
You can add the argument `na.rm = TRUE` to calculate the result while ignoring
the missing values.

```{r}
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights)
max(heights)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

If your data include missing values, you may want to become familiar with the
functions `is.na()`, `na.omit()`, and `complete.cases()`. See below for
examples.


```{r}
## Extract those elements which are not missing values.
heights[!is.na(heights)]
## Returns the object with incomplete cases removed. The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or `"double"`).
na.omit(heights)
## Extract those elements which are complete cases. The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or `"double"`).
heights[complete.cases(heights)]
```
Recall that you can use the `typeof()` function to find the type of your atomic vector.

## Data Frames

Data frames are the _de facto_ data structure for most tabular data, and what we
use for statistics and plotting.

A data frame can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by the
functions `read.csv()` or `read_csv()` (tidyverse version); in other words, when importing
spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web).

A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the
columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because columns are
vectors, each column must contain a single type of data (e.g., characters, integers,
factors). For example, here is a figure depicting a data frame comprising a
numeric, a character, and a logical vector.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datacarpentry/R-ecology-lesson/master/img/data-frame.svg) 

***
We are going to use the R function `download.file()` to download the CSV file
that contains the survey data from Figshare, and we will use `read.csv()` to
load into memory the content of the CSV file as an object of class `data.frame`. 

Inside the download.file command, the first entry is a character string with the source URL 
("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169"). This source URL downloads a CSV file from 
figshare. The text after the comma ("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv") is the destination of the 
file on your local machine. You'll need to have a folder on your machine called "data_raw" where 
you'll download the file. So this command downloads a file from Figshare, names it 
"portal_data_joined.csv" and adds it to a preexisting folder named "data_raw".

```{r}
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```


You are now ready to load the data:
```{r}
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

This statement doesn't produce any output because, as you might recall,
assignments don't display anything. If we want to check that our data has been
loaded, we can see the contents of the data frame by typing its name: `surveys`.
```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
surveys
```

Wow... that was a lot of output. At least it means the data loaded
properly. Let's check the top (the first 6 lines) of this data frame using the
function `head()`:
```{r}
head(surveys)
```

```{r}
## Try also
View(surveys)
```

We can see this when inspecting the <b>str</b>ucture of a data frame
with the function `str()`:

```{r}
str(surveys)
```

### Inspecting `data.frame` Objects

We already saw how the functions `head()` and `str()` can be useful to check the
content and the structure of a data frame. Here is a non-exhaustive list of
functions to get a sense of the content/structure of the data. Let's try them out!

We already saw how the functions `head()` and `str()` can be useful to check the
content and the structure of a data frame. Here is a non-exhaustive list of
functions to get a sense of the content/structure of the data. Let's try them out!

1. Size:
  + `dim(surveys)` - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element, and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of the object)
  + `nrow(surveys)` - returns the number of rows
  + `ncol(surveys)` - returns the number of columns
2. Content:
  + `head(surveys)` - shows the first 6 rows
  + `tail(surveys)` - shows the last 6 rows
3. Names:
  + `names(surveys)` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for `data.frame` objects)
  + `rownames(surveys)` - returns the row names
4. Summary:
  + `str(surveys)` - structure of the object and information about the class, length and content of  each column
  + `summary(surveys)` - summary statistics for each column
  
Note: most of these functions are "generic", they can be used on other types of
objects besides `data.frame`.

### Indexing and subsetting data frames

Our survey data frame has rows and columns (it has 2 dimensions), if we want to
extract some specific data from it, we need to specify the "coordinates" we
want from it. Row numbers come first, followed by column numbers. However, note
that different ways of specifying these coordinates lead to results with
different classes.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
# first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[1, 1]   
# first element in the 6th column (as a vector)
surveys[1, 6]   
# first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[, 1]    
# first column of the data frame (as a data.frame)
surveys[1]      
# first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)
surveys[1:3, 7] 
# the 3rd row of the data frame (as a data.frame)
surveys[3, ]    
# equivalent to head_surveys <- head(surveys)
head_surveys <- surveys[1:6, ] 
```

`:` is a special function that creates numeric vectors of integers in increasing
or decreasing order, test `1:10` and `10:1` for instance.
You can also exclude certain indices of a data frame using the "`-`" sign:
```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys[, -1]          # The whole data frame, except the first column
surveys[-c(7:34786), ] # Equivalent to head(surveys)
```
Data frames can be subset by calling indices (as shown previously), but also by calling their column names directly:
```{r, eval = FALSE, purl=FALSE}
surveys["species_id"]       # Result is a data.frame
surveys[, "species_id"]     # Result is a vector
surveys[["species_id"]]     # Result is a vector
surveys$species_id          # Result is a vector
```
In RStudio, you can use the autocompletion feature to get the full and correct names of the columns.

Like we've seen in the section on vectors, data frames can also be subset using logical tests:
```{r}
females <- surveys[surveys$sex=="F",]
head(females)
```


## Challenges

### Assigning values to objects

What are the values after each statement in the following?

```{r}
mass <- 47.5            # mass?
# mass is 47.5
age  <- 122             # age?
# age is 122
mass <- mass * 2.0      # mass?
# mass is 95
age  <- age - 20        # age?
# age is 102
mass_index <- mass/age  # mass_index?
# mass_index is 95/102 = 0.93137
```

### Vectors
We’ve seen that atomic vectors can be of type character,
numeric (or double), integer, and logical. But what happens if we try to mix these types in
a single vector?

> R implicitly converts them to all be the same type

What will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use `class()`
to check the data type of your objects):

```{r}
num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
# coerced to type chr
num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
# coerced to type num
char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
# coerced to type chr
tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
# coerced to type chr
```

Why do you think it happens?


> Vectors can be of only one data type. R tries to convert (coerce) the content of this vector to find a "common denominator" that doesn't lose any information.


How many values in `combined_logical` are `"TRUE"` (as a character) in the
following example (reusing the 2 `..._logical`s from above):

```{r}
combined_logical <- c(num_logical, char_logical)
```

> Only one. There is no memory of past data types, and the coercion happens the first time the vector is evaluated. Therefore, the `TRUE` in `num_logical` gets converted into a `1` before it gets converted into `"1"` in `combined_logical`.

In R, we call converting objects from one class into another class
_coercion_. These conversions happen according to a hierarchy,
whereby some types get preferentially coerced into other
types. From the examples above, can you draw a diagram that represents the hierarchy of how
these data types are coerced?

> logical &#8594; numeric &#8594; character &#8592; logical

### Logical test

```{r}
# Reminder of logical tests:
4>5 # FALSE

"i" == "I" # FALSE

5 == "five" # FALSE

"i" %in% letters # TRUE - letters is a vector of the alphabet in lower case
```


Can you figure out why `"four" > "five"` returns `TRUE`?
```{r}
"four" > "five"
```

> When using ">" or "<" on strings, R compares their alphabetical order. 
> Here "four" comes after "five", and therefore is "greater than" it.

### Subsetting/Removing NAs

1. Using this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector, `heights_no_na`, with the NAs removed.

```{r, eval= FALSE}
heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)
```


2. Use the function `median()` to calculate the median of the `heights` vector.

3. Use R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.

```{r}
heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)

# 1.
heights_no_na <- heights[!is.na(heights)] 
# or
heights_no_na <- na.omit(heights)
# or
heights_no_na <- heights[complete.cases(heights)]

# 2.
median(heights, na.rm = TRUE) # 64

# 3.
heights_above_67 <- heights_no_na[heights_no_na > 67]
length(heights_above_67) # 6
```


### Data.frames

Based on the output of `str(surveys)`, can you answer the following questions?

* What is the class of the object `surveys`?
* How many rows and how many columns are in this object?
* How many species have been recorded during these surveys?

```{r, answer=TRUE, results="markup", purl=FALSE}
str(surveys)

## * class: data frame
## * how many rows: 34786,  how many columns: 13
## * how many species: 48
```

#### Subsetting 

1. Create a `data.frame` (`surveys_200`) containing only the data in
row 200 of the `surveys` dataset.

2. Notice how `nrow()` gave you the number of rows in a `data.frame`?

* Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame.
* Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` to make
sure it's meeting expectations.
* Pull out that last row using `nrow()` instead of the row number.
* Create a new data frame (`surveys_last`) from that last row.

3. Use `nrow()` to extract the row that is in the middle of the data
frame. Store the content of this row in an object named `surveys_middle`.

4. Combine `nrow()` with the `-` notation above to reproduce the behavior of
`head(surveys)`, keeping just the first through 6th rows of the surveys
